    "Like our neuron cells, an artificial neuron will allow the transmission of some signals only when some threshold, based on the inputs, is reached. \n",
    "In our artificial neutron, this threshold is known as a bias, $b$. \n",
    "The inputs, $x_n$, are the data that we input to the neuron, which are acted on by wights, $w_n$, and combined in some transfer function, $f(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w})$. \n",

    ":class: tip\n",
    "If we consider a biological neuron, this takes signals from the dendrites, which are connected to other neurons (the inputs). \n",
    "In the cell body, the signals are processed, and it is determined whether the neuron will fire an electrical signal. \n",
    "The processing involves weighting the signals based on the strength of the synaptic connections (this process is analogous to the weights and the transfer function). \n",
    "If the processing results in a signal being fired (an output), this is transmitted down the axon to be received by other neurons. \n",
