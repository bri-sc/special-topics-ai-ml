    "# Long Short-Term Memory Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular network type for sequential data is long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. \n",
    "These networks were explicitly designed to address some of the limitations of recurrent neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional recurrent neural networks suffer from what is known as the *vanishing gradient*. \n",
    "The vanishing gradient leads to long-term dependencies fading over the span of the data. \n",
    "This fading occurs as the backpropagation process with the activation function for recurrent neural networks leads to the gradient shrinking exponentially as it passes through the data.\n",
    "This leads to recurrent neural networks being considered as having short-term memories. \n",
    "\n",
    "The long short-term memory networks include what is known as *memory cells* to store, update, and forget information using gates selectively:\n",
    "- Forget Gate: what information should be discarded?\n",
    "- Input Gate: what new information should be stored?\n",
    "- Output Gate: Controls the output based on the memory and hidden state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bringing together these gates prevents information from being lost over long data sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A Single Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "A single LSTM perceptron can be built from the constituent gates. \n",
    "For each data point, the LSTM updates the hidden state, $h_i$, and the cell state, $c_i, as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, a forget gate is used to determine what should be discarded, \n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    f_i = f(W_f x_i + U_f h_{i-1} + b_f),\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where $f$ is a logistic function, and $W_f$, $U_f$ and $b_f$, are parameters of the forget gate (hence the $f$ subscript). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. An input gate is concurrently used to select what should be stored,\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    n_i = f(W_nx_i + U_nh_{i-1} + b_n).\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. These are both used to update the cell state, $c_i$, \n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\tilde{c}_i = \\tanh(W_cx_i + U_ch_{i-1} + b_c),\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    c_i = f_i \\odot c_{i-1} + n_i \\odot \\tilde{c}_i,\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where $\\odot$ indicates elementwise multiplication, known as the Hadamard product. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The output gate is then used to determine the final output, $o_i$, and update the hidden state,\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    o_i = f(W_ox_i + U_o h_{i-1} + b_o),\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    h_i = o_i \\odot \\tanh(c_i).\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put this together in a Python class. "
