    "# Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Training is a familiar concept across machine learning methods. \n",
    "Our training aims to teach our model about the data we have shown so that it can predict outcomes that it has not seen yet. \n",
    "Here, we will look at training a simple XOR operation multilayer perceptron. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Pavlov's Dog\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "We can use the famous experiment of Pavlov's dog to explain the training process. \n",
    "Every time Pavlov rang a bell, he would give his dog a treat.\n",
    "Over time, the dog began to associate the bell with the treat, and therefore, he would salivate when he heard the bell. \n",
    "This *training* leads to changes in the processing in the cell body of the dog's biological neurons and is directly analogous to the training we will perform on the artificial neural network. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular training algorithm for neural networks is known as *backpropagation*. \n",
    "Let's look at using this to train the XOR operation above. \n",
    "Above, we have three layers, i.e., $M=3$, where the output layer is the *M*th-layer and $y_{\\textrm{pred},i}$ will be the final prediction. \n",
    "We define some *loss function* that we will use in the optimisation. \n",
    "Here we use the mean-squared error (MSE),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_{\\textrm{pred},i} - y_i)^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of outputs (for the XOR, this is 1), and $y_i$ is the true value (from our truth table).\n",
    "We implement this with `jax` for reasons that will become clear."
