    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of applications that enable interactive Jupyter Notebooks. \n",
    "By far, the most popular is [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org), which is the standard application for working with Jupyter Notebooks and includes a simple text editor. \n",
    "However, another popular tool is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), this is a text editor {cite}`footnote2`, and therefore it will be mentioned again later, that is capable of running interactive Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "VSCode is not the only text editor available, it is just one that supports the use of notebooks.\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "Both JupyterLab and VSCode are great tools for working with Notebooks; some people enjoy working entirely in one environment (be that JupyterLab or VSCode), while others prefer to run their Notebooks in JupyterLab and using VSCode, or another text editor, to edit modules and scripts. \n",
    "It is a point of preference, it is best to try both options and find out which suits best.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anaconda \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get JupyterLab and a Python installation running locally is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download#). \n",
    "Anaconda includes a Python distribution with a large number of useful libraries as standard, in addition to tools such as JupyterLab (and VSCode). \n",
    "Downloading and installing the Anaconda distribution will install the \"Anaconda Navigator\" application on your computer.\n",
    "When this application is opened, it is possible to launch JupyterLab from the Home screen, which should open the JupyterLab interface in the default web browser.\n",

    "Anaconda is not the only way to get JupyterLab running locally, for example, [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html#mamba-installation) can be used to install JupyterLab, however, this requires some familiarity with the command line to install. \n",
