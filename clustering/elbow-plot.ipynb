    "# How Many Clusters Do I Have?\n",
    "\n",
    "A common question in clustering methods, particularly those that require a pre-defined number of clusters, is \"how many clusters?\". \n",
    "A few approaches can be taken to answer this; here, we will discuss the elbow plot, but there is also the silhouette plot. \n",
    "For more information about the latter, [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.html) has a nice article discussing them. \n",
    "\n",
    "## *k*-Means Elbow Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "The elbow plot has [previously been discussed](/dim-reduction/pca-interpretation.html#how-many-principal-components-to-investigate) in the context of principal components analysis. \n",
    "However, in PCA, the *y*-axis is the proportion of the explained variance, a parameter that is not necessarily generated from *k*-means or other clustering approaches. \n",
    "Therefore, a different metric is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular metric that is used for an elbow plot in clustering is *inertia*, $I$, which is calculated as, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I = \\sum_{c}\\left(\\sum_{x \\in c}(|x - \\mu_c|^2)\\right),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e., the sum of the squared distances between the samples, $x$, and their closest centres, $\\mu_c$. \n",
    "This metric is calculated using the `sklearn.cluster.KMean` fit method.\n",
    "Let's test this with another simple *fake* blob dataset. "
