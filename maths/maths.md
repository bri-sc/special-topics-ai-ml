# Why Maths? 

Machine learning is an inherently mathematical subject, with lienar algebra, statistics, and probability at its heart.
Therefore, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topics in machine learning and artificial intelligence it is necessary to introduce important mathematical aspects. 
Some of the mathematics we cover here may already be familiar, but hopefully the recap is useful (or perhaps it is interesting to hear a slightly different explanation).
