# Why Maths? 

Machine learning is an inherently mathematical subject, with linear algebra, calculus, and probability at its heart.
Therefore, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of machine learning and artificial intelligence topics, it is necessary to introduce important mathematical aspects. 
Some of the mathematics we cover here may already be familiar, but hopefully, the recap is helpful (or perhaps it is interesting to hear a slightly different explanation).
