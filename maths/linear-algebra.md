# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that handles {term}`vectors` and {term}`matrices`. 
Operations involving vectors and matrices are fundamental to many areas of the physical sciences, but also data science and machine learning techniques. 
An understanding of linear algebra is really important to understand how *and why* data science tools work. 

Here, linear algebra concepts will be introduced and later used to explain the data science methods used. 
It is possible to use methods from data science without understanding the exact way that they work, however, a more complete understanding is possible with linear algebra.

The terms vector and matrix may not be familiar, but they will be introduced in detail along with the operations that are performed with them.

Much of the conceptual explanation in this section is built from the videos of 3Blue1Brown. 
In particular, the [series on linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) gives a great explanation of many of the concepts.
