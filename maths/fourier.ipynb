    "Probably the most important integral in science is the Fourier transform. \n",
    "The Fourier transform was first developed in 1822 by French mathematician [Joesph Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier), who was trying to create an analytical theory of heat transfer. \n",
    "In the process of doing this, he claimed that any function, continuous or discontinuous, can be described with an expanded series of sine waves; the process of this expansion is a **Fourier transform**. \n",
    "From this expanded series of sine waves, we can obtain information about the frequency of the function, which, as we will see, is very useful in analysing scientific data. \n",

    "The Fourier transform is a valuable tool in chemistry and physics, where it can be used to estimate the structure of molecules from diffraction. \n",
    "Diffraction is the process where waves of light (X-rays), neutrons, or electrons interact with the periodic structure of a molecular system, such as a crystal lattice. \n",
    "As these waves encounter the regularly spaced atoms in a molecule or crystal, they scatter in specific directions due to constructive and destructive interference.\n",
    "We can think of a diffraction pattern as the Fourier transform of the positions of the molecules in space. \n",
    "```\n",
