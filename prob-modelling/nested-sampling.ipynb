    "# Nested Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular and efficient algorithm to estimate the Bayesian evidence is known as nested sampling. \n",
    "Nested sampling was developed by the physicist John Skilling to improve the efficiency of Bayesian evidence estimation {cite}`Skilling2004`. \n",
    "The nested sampling algorithm aims to transform a high-dimensional evidence integral&mdash;recalling that the dimensionality of the evidence integral is the same as the number of paramters&mdash;into a one-dimensional sum over likelihood values. \n",
    "The nested sampling algorithm is conceptually relatively simple. \n",
    "Initially, we will describe it by analogy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Adventuring a Landscape\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "Consider a group of explorers investigating a mountainous landscape (the integral we want to compute). \n",
    "Instead of wandering randomly across the mountains (as in Markov chain Monte Carlo), nested sampling starts by placing a series of *scouts* randomly across the terrain (the placements are random samples from our priors).\n",
    "The scout in the lowest valley (the area of lowest probability) is replaced by a new one in a higher location. \n",
    "Over time, scouts climb higher and higher, focussing more and more on the landscape's most important (highest probability) regions. \n",
    "In keeping track of how much area/volume is discarded at each step of the algorithm to build up an estimation of the total volume of the landscape, the Bayesian evidence integral. \n",
    "```\n",

    "## The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The nested sampling algorithm starts with a formulation of the Bayesian evidence integral, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(D | M) = \\int p[D | M(\\Theta)]p[M(\\Theta)]\\;\\text{d}\\Theta,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(D | M(\\Theta))$ is the likelihood and $p(M(\\Theta))$ is the prior. \n",
    "We then introduce the *prior volume**, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X(\\lambda) = \\int_{p[D | M(\\Theta)] > \\lambda} p[M(\\Theta)]\\;\\text{d}\\Theta, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "such that $X(\\lambda)$ represents the total prior mass where the likelihood is greater than $\\lambda$. \n",
    "From this, we can rewrite the evidence as, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(D | M) = \\int_0^1 p(D | X)\\;\\text{d}X, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $p(D | X)$ is the likelihood value corresponding to the prior volume $X$. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the problem then reformulated, we can start to implement the algorithm. \n",
    "To achieve this, we are considering likelihood and prior functions that are both two-dimensional normal distributions over the parameters, $\\Theta = [\\theta_1, \\theta_2]$. "
